# Upgrade Hub- Pet-Manager API

## About the project:

-At the bootcamp we were invited to make our own project, the theme I chose was a shelter for cats.
I create 5 packages:"model","service","controller","repository","utili" and "exception". Inside the ShelterController, VolunteerController and the FamilyHostFamily i put several endpoints to perform basic CRUD operations (Get,Post,Put,Delete).

❗ first steps ❗
- Create the Spring Boot project in Spring Initialiazr.
- Then, create a new database in MySQL
- create an account in https://hub.docker.com/

# How to run the application

-- mvn clean install
-- build docker file 
-- docker-compose up...

## 💡Important notes:
- In order to put api running you need to install docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

##  🐳 What's is Docker? 
So, Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
